<!-- The "<style>" Tag
  This tag is used inside the "<head>" tag for styling specfic HTML elements.
  We can style a specific HTML element by using the element's name, and between curly braces we add the CSS property and its value.
  When using CSS this way it is possible to style multiple elements at once.

<!-- Order of precendence
  Inline CSS -> Internal CSS -> External CSS
-->

<!-- Default CSS
  It is important to know that the browser applies a CSS style by default.
  These values are: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_default_values.asp
  For the "<hr>" tag, we have as default:
    display: block;
    margin-top: 0.5em;
    margin-bottom: 0.5em;
    margin-left: auto;
    margin-right: auto;
    border-style: inset;
    border-width: 1px;
  OBS: It is also important to keep in mind that basically all the elements in the webpage are just boxes. The "pesticide" Chrome extension can be used for displaying those boxes.
-->

<!-- The "height" property
  This property is used for altering the height of HTML elements.
  Pretty much any element can use this property.
  The same works for the "<width>" property.
  Instead of using a fixed value we can use a porcentage that varies according to the user's screen. VERY IMPORTANT.
  OBS: If an element has no height, its backgound color will be redundant. Example in the "hr" element being edited in the "<style>" tag.
-->

<!-- Possible improvement
  From past experiences, when working with elements that we can edit multiple properties, for example "border-style", since there are four borders, it's better to alter all of
  them in a single property rather than making properties depend on each other inside a code-block. So, instead of using "border-style", to set all the other borders to a
  particular value, and then set the "border-top-style" to a value (creating a dependency between properties), we should just define the "border-style" and alter all the values.
-->

<!-- Disadvantage of internal CSS
  Internal CSS is a little bit better than inline CSS since we can attribute a style to multiple HTML elements in a page, however is NOT the recommended version.
  According to this scenario, if we have multiple HTML pages we would have to copy the internal CSS to each one of the other pages.
  For that reason external CSS is the best to use (best practise).
