<!-- CSS
  CSS stands for "Cascading Style Sheet", which is used to style HTML elements, it can be used inline or through an external file.
  Using though an external file is recommended, meaning that it's considered as the best practise.
-->

<!-- The "style" Attribute
  This attribute is used to introduce CSS code into HTML elements, this way we can sytle elements inline.
  Notice that CSS code follows a different pattern from HTML code, in other words we need to use ":" and put a semi colon at the end of the statement.
-->

<!-- The "background-color" Property
  This is a CSS propery that's used for changing an HTML element's color. We can use a color name or an hexadecimal as value.
  To figure out which color names that we can use it's necessary to look at the documentation ("https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/color_value").
  The site that was suggested for picking colors was "colorhunt.co".
  Because of the "pigment" package we have a preview of the color.
-->

<!-- The disadvantage of using inline CSS
  The main disadvantage when using CSS in this way is that if we want to style multiple elements that use the same tag we have to edit one by one.
