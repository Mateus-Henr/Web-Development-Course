<!-- Using external CSS
  The code that was before a internal CSS has been moved to the styles.css file, making it an external CSS. So we can use it in multiple files.
  The only thing that we have to do is to define the "<link>" tag in our files.
-->

<!-- The "<link>" tag
  This tag is used to link another file to our HTML file, we can pass the file that we are going to link through the "href" attribute.
  When an "href" starts with a "/", it makes the path relatives to the root, in our case the root is "CSS - Personal Site".
  The "rel" attribute shows that there's a relation with the value, so when your browser goes over the header part, it sees where the "stylesheet" resides.
  By doing it, the browser goes to the specified file and applies all the styles in there into your HTML elements.
