API

Endpoints
Every API that interacts with an external system will have an endpoint.
An endpoint for a API is an URL which you can access the data.
It's important to notice that every time you search an URL on the browser, behind the curtains, the browser will be doing a GET request to the website to get the data.
Ex: "https://api.kanye.rest".

Paths
This is used to narrow down in a specific piece of data.
For the most handy API, we need to specify a path which is an additional information that comes after the URL.
Ex: "https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/joke/Programming". (The "Programming" part is the path, the rest is the endpoint for the API).

Parameters
This is also used to narrow down in a specific piece of data.
This is usually used when they don't have a path ahead of time due to the high number of possibilities of search. So parameters are used for this purpose.
An example of use of parameters is if we want to search for a specific thing in a API, so then we send a string in order to match with some specific data.
They go at the end of the URL after a quotation mark. Following that, there's a key value pair.
You can also specify more than one value to a key, you just have to separate them using a comma.
Parameters are separated by a "&".
Ex: "https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/joke/Programming?contains=debugging". ("contains=debugging" is a parameter which "contains" is the key, and "debugging" is the query).
Ex: "https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/joke/Programming?contains=debugging&blacklistFlags=nsfw,religious".
