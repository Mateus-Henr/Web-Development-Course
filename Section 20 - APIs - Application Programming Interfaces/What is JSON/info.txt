JSON
It stands for "JavaScript Object Notation" since it does follow a similar pattern as defining objects in JS.
This format is used because it's in the middle of being able to be read by a human and of not taking much space in the machine.
Apart from JSON, there are also other formats, such as XML, and HTML.
