APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)
APIs can be useful when you want a specific data like the weather forecast in an organized manner.
There are APIs for the most several purposes. For example, Facebook has an API for other apps to get data from it.
An API is a set of commands, functions, protocols and objects that programmers can use to create software or interact with an external system.
It's like a contract between the data provider and the developers. And we cannot change the methods, protocols, without notifying the data provider.
An example of an API used for software creation is jQuery.
