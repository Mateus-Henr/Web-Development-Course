API

Authentication
Every time that you make a request to the API the have to be able to identify who's sending the request.
Depending on the API, mainly the biggest ones, they keep track of how many times you getting data, in order to charge you.
Here is where the key comes in. A key ("appid") is a bunch of characters that are used when you want to authenticate yourself when making requests to the API.
The order of the parameters in a API request doesn't matter.
Ex: "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat=35&lon=139&appid=43243243252dsda5435".

Postman
It's used for testing APIs. It organizes things more since you can enter the parameters individually.
