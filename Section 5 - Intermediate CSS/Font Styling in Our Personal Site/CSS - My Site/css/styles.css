/* CSS fonts
  The "serif" in fonts are the little edges that some have.
  We can use the "font-family" property for changing fonts on our website.
  Some fonts
    sans-serif: Without edges (Arial).
    serif: With little edges (Default - Times New Roman).
    monospace: The letters take up the same space.
    OBS: The other dafault fonts are barely never used since they make readability harder.

  It's possible to define two fonts, but this depends on the browser. Below what we are doing is: Asking the browser if it can render the "verdana" font, if so, it'll render
  the "verdana" otherwise it'll try to render the other font that in our case is "sans-serif".
  That's why there are the "web safe fonts" which are fonts that most operation systems/browsers can display. However, no font is a hundred percent "web safe".
  There's something called "fall back" that's when multiple fonts are defined in order to get a compatibility in one. The names of the fonts are placed one after the other and
  the first font that the user has on hist/her PC will be used for rendering test. This is used as some sort of insurance going from a specific font to a less specific one.
  Already made font stacks can be found at "www.cssfontstack.com".

  Font embedding
  Through this, we can embed a font to our website, making sure that that same font is going to be displayed for all the users that are accessing the website.
  The best place for looking for this type of fonts is "www.fonts.google.com". They have fonts that are free for comercial use.
  To embed a font to a website all that's necessary is to cpy the "<link>" provided by the font's site and paste it in the HTML head tag.
  These links specify a location to get the font from in case of the user not having it in his/her system.
  Even though defining a font like this is more "secure", there's still the possibility of the font not being rendered, let's suppose that the internet went down, that's why
  is important to define a "fall back" font in case of a situation like this arises.
