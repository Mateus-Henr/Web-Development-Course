<!-- Favicon
  It's the icon that appears on the browser tab.
  It has this name "favicon" ("Favorite icon") because back in the old days, it was the icon that would appear together with the name of a site that you had as favorite.
  And it was possible to see how many times people requested the icon therefore they could know how many people had their sites favorited.
  We can use the site "https://www.favicon.cc/" to create your icon.

<!-- Linking the favicon
  For linking a favicon to a website we need to use the "<link>" tag, with a relation ("rel") of "icon".
  Also you need to mention its path.
