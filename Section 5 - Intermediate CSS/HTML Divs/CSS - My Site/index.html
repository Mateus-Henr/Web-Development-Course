<!-- The "<div>" tag
  It's a special HTML element that allows us to divide our content up on our website.
  They don't do anything unless you use CSS with it.
  It actually stands for a content division element, allowing us to split up stuff into separated containers or boxes, so you can manage each separately.
  By default when it has content within it, it'll have a size based on the content within it.
