<!-- The "span" element
  This HTML element is used for editing text, can be used for highlighting, for example.
  Just as "<div>" it doesn't take any space by default.
  It differs from "<div>" since this element has an INLINE diplay property set by default. Meaning that it is recommended for editing text since it will stay on the same line.
  By using it alone, you can style the space covered only by the content within the enclosing tags.
