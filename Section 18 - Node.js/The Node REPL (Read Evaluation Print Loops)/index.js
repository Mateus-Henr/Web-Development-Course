/*  REPL (Read, Evaluation, Print, Loop)
  It allows us to execute code in byte size chuncks. In other words, we can run several lines of codes one after the other.
  To access the REPL you can just type "node" on the command line.
  Also, by pressing TAB on an incomplete function name, you can see all the possible functions that you can use.

  Exiting the REPL
  ".exit" or "Ctrl + C" twice. However "Ctrl + C" is more overall used.

// Ex: 3 + 9 => 12
