Forking
This is when you copy a remote repository into another remote owned by you.
Once you fork a remote repository, you now own it. And that person is added as a member.

Pull request
This pull request is a way to make a "suggestion", being it the code that was written.
This is necessary because the person making this "suggestion" doesn't have the rights to modify the repository, therefore he/she sends the code "asking" to look at his/her
modifications. So then, who owns the repository can look at the code and maybe even, merge the new updates into the current project.
It's called a pull request because the owner that decides whether the code will be incorporated into the project. Therefore, the owner would be "pulling" the changes over.
If the changes are proved to be compatible and viable, then the owner could accept the pull request and merge the new code to the remote repository.
Also, the change doesn't get reflected on the master branch, but in a separate branch.

Forking and Pull Request
As you might have noticed above, these two exist in order to interact with open source codes.
And usually, the person forks a repository, so then he/she can make pull requests.
After that, the person who owns the repository can see the pull request and choose if he/she wants to merge that request to the master branch.
