GitHub
GitHub is used to create a remote repository that can be accessed in someone's computer if given permission.

Pushing files to a repository on GitHub

Creating a remote
This is the first thing that you should do after creating a remote repository.
We have to create a remote in order to tell our local repository that we have created a local repository, and that we want to transfer our commits over there.
  git remote add origin <SSH_URL> ("origin" is the name of the remote chosen by convention)
Ex:
  git remote add origin git@github.com:Mateus-Henr/Story.git


Sending files over to the remote repository
  git push -u origin master
This pushes your local repository to the remote repository. The "-u" links up both repositories. After that, we push it to the remote called "origin", and to the "master" branch
in that remote. The "master" branch is the default one.


Seeing your commit history
If you go to "Insights", then "Network graph", on GitHub, you can have a look at your commits.


Local repository
Once we have a few commits in the local repository, the timeline of commits is called the "master branch" which is your main branch of save points.
Our local repository is the ".git" folder. When we use "git push", we push all of the commits in the local repository to the remote one.
