".gitignore" file

This is usually used when you don't want to commit a file/folder into your remote repository. Stuff that would be considered as secret as well, such as API keys, passwords, etc.
Be aware that GitHub is an open platform, due to that it's really important to keep access tokens, passwords, etc, away from the remote repository.
Gitignore has as purpose to ignore files specified within it, so they don't get uploaded on GitHub.
For adding comments we can use the "#" sign.
It's also possible to add wildcards.
The GitHub team has a repository with templates for gitignore files which is quite handy.

Ex:
  #Files to be ignored
  .DS_Store
  secret.txt


".DS_Store" file
This is a file that arranges how your project is going to be shown.
This file is usually not committed since its a personal choice of the arrangement of the files in your project.


Deleting files and folders within the staging area
  "git rm --cached -r ."
OBS: The "-r" flag means to delete everything recursively.
