Wireframing
This is a low fidelity representation of the design for a website. One of the first thing that you do when designing a website.
The opposite of it, it's called a mock up. A mock up is a high fidelity representation of a website, in other words, the end result, just through designing.
A mock up is preferable if you have already the idea of how the website is going to be, so other person can develop it for example. However, as it's a high fidelity
representation it can consume a lot of time in futile details such as colours and shapes.

Structure and UI patterns - 1째 step
In order to decide which structure and UI patterns fit the better for your website, you should start by looking at sites such as "ui-patterns.com", "dribbble.com", always trying
to correlate the problems that you are trying to solve.

Wireframing - 2째 step
This is when you develop a general layout in order to get some feedback from it. "balsamiq.com" is a good website for building it.

Mock-up - 3째 step (optional)
A more precise design of the website, photo realistic versions of that's going to be developed. It also gets feedbacks.

Prototype - 4째 step  (optional)
An animated version of the website, which shows exactly how it's going to be and how it's going to perform under user's interactions.

An simple wireframe created by me can be found in the same folder as this file.
