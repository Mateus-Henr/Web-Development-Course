<!-- Container
  The Bootstrap container is automatically responsive.

<body>
  <!-- Default container -->
  <div class="container" style="background-color: red">
    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
    when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap
    into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
  </div>

  <!-- Fluid container
      This type of container always match the entire width of the screen, so it doesn't breakup when changing the display view.
