<!-- Bootstrap
  It's part of the front end logic of a website, it's basically a bunch of reusable code for making the design of the website much easier.
  Originally designed by Twitter for the purpose of consistency throughout websites, being it the most famous framework for front end.
  One of the main advantages of Bootstrap is to make the website responsible.
  It offers predefined classes that we can freely use. Also, when using it, it overwrites some of the browser default stylesheet.
  Another advantage of it is because it's very famous, the user might have already accessed a website in the past that contains the Bootstrap files, due to that, the browser
  caches these files so that the user doesn't have to download them every single time when accessing a website that uses it.
-->

<!-- CDN
  It stands for "Content Delivery Network".
  Summing up, it spreads your website around multiple locations to make the access to it easier rather than being found only at a single location.
  In the case of Bootstrap, for example, it uses "CDN" in order to make its contents load faster when being used by someone. It looks for the shortest route to download
  the files in question.

<!-- Ways of adding Bootstrap to a website
  -> Using the "<link>" tag for downloading the files through CDN. BEST WAY.
  -> Using the Bootstrap starter template that's available on the company's website. BEST WAY FROM SCRATCH.
  -> Downloading the CSS and JS source code. So instead of pointing to a URL on the internet you can point directly to your website files,
     where will contain the Bootstrap's files. The downside of this is that the browser doesn't match these files with the ones that are downloaded from the URL link.
     Consequently the browser will download all the files again, even if they have already been cached before.
