    /* Some GOOD PRACTISES */

    /* It's also important to remember the priorities depending on where the CSS code is, internal < internal < external. */

    /* Preventing from creating conflicting rules
      In order to avoid the type of situation where you have code overriding each other because of the order of precedence, the
      best way to avoid it is to use ID only in rare occasions (very sparingly), don't try to use it when you can use a class.
      Even if we have only one element it's better to use a class.
      ID is normally used for sections (due to navigation), and bootstrap elements when in the need of it.
    */

    /*  Use only one class
      Another good practise is to not use multiple little classes to modify an element.
      Trying to apply a single custom class is the best way.
