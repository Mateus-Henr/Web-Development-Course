<!-- Displaying an element on top of another
  Making the element a children
  Children sit on the top of the parent element, so by nesting an element inside another, we would have a child and by default,
  this child sits on the top of the parent.

  Default stacking order
  If the elements occupy the same position (let's say that we are using an absolute positioning, meaning that we are taking the elements
  out of the flow), the one that is more on the top of the file will be closer to the back.
  In other words, the one that was last created will be sitting on the top.
  This is the natural stacking order.

  The "z-index" property
  This property is used for changing the natural stacking order according to the prgorammer's will. This means that it's not necessary
  to chang ethe HTMl code in order for changing the stacking order, we can do it by simply editing the CSS code.
  It only works if the element has a position. DOES NOT WORK with static positioning, which is the default one.
  The default z-index of an element is 0.
