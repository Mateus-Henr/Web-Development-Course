<!-- Website in mobiles
    Among the multiple ways that Google search uses to rank a website, the mobile-friendliness of a website is one of them.
    Google even offers a "mobile-friendly test" in which you can enter a URL to see whether a website is accessible for mobiles.
    Some companies have a different website for mobile devices, such as Facebook (the URL changes to match a mobile device).
    However, the best solution is to make your website responsive, rather than creating an entire new project for devices.
    And in cases that the Bootstrap reponsiveness doesn't apply, we have the media query breakpoints that can be used in plain CSS.
--->

<!-- Media queries
  The "@media print" query is used for modifying thwe CSS code for when the user's printing the website.
  The "@media screen" is related to the screen resolution.
  The "@media speech" gets activated if the website is being read.

  Structure
  @media <type> <feature>
  OBS: "feature" is the condition in which it gets activated.

  Example
  @media screen (min-width: 900px)
  {
    // Change something.
  }

  Media query breakpoints
  They could be considered as "conditions" since they analyse a state and if that state meets the conditon, the code
  being enclosed by the media query gets enacted.
  It's also possible to combine multiple "types" by using the word "and" between them.

  Confusing "types"
  "min-width" means that we are targetting from that value upwards.
  "max-width" means that we are targetting from that value downwards.

  Terms
  Viewport is the size of the screen that a website is being displayed on.
  Device width is a fixed size, the actual size of a device.
  Browser size is changeable since the user has the ability of modifying its window.

  Designing a website
  There are debates, which either choose to start styling a website for mobile or desktop first,
  but it's better to do it both ways.
