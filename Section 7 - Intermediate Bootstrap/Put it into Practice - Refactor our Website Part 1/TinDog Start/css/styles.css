/*  Code Refactoring
  1. Readability
    Organization, comments, well structured and etc.
  2. Modularity
    How easy it is to reuse bits of your code. If one part of the website breaks down would you easily be able to find the
    problem?
  3. Efficiency
    How fast does you code run?
  4. Length (recreational)
    The number of lines of the code.

/* Multiple occurrences of a property
  If a property is appearing multiple times throughout your code, it may be advantageous to define it within the "body" tag.

/*  GOOD PRACTISES
   Usually HTML tags shouldn't be targetted with sizes and proportions since they are a very "broad" elemement.
   For this reason, alterations that changed the font's proportions have been moved to a more specific class.
   Normally, we only target the type of the font and colors.
   It's possible to set values for multiple selectors by using the syntax below.
   NEVER STYLE HTML'S PROPERTIES ALONE ALWAYS CREATE A CLASS FOR THEM.
   ALWAYS BE SPECIFIC SINCE IT EXTREMELY HELPS FUTURE MODIFICATIONS.
   This is what is meant by modularity, you can narrow down a specific section very easily, since they are
   organized in "modules". So you can edit a specific part without altering the entire website.
