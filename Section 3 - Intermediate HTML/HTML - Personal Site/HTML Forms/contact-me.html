<!-- Forms in HTML
  Forms require a bit more of HTML, in this case it reuires JavaScript, since we need to specify the behaviour of a form.
  Therefore, we will only structure and style the form.
-->

<!-- The "<form>" Tag
  Inside of this tag, we usually use a "<label>" tag to display what the user has to enter and after that we use a "<input>" tag.
  It's worth mentioning that the "<input>" tag has various types, for example the "color" value will display a color picker.
  We also have a "submit" button in a form, however instead of using an actual button, we use an "<input>" element with a HTML attrivute of "submit".
  And the "<input>" element is a self-closing tag.
-->

<!-- The Password Input
  When using this type of value in the "type" attribute we have a password field, this field doesn't allow copying values from it and it doesn't display what the user entered.
