<!-- Why "index.html"?
  This name is commonly used by developers to name their home page.

<!-- Boilerplate code
  The word "boilerplate" is used to mention the code that's often use as default when creating a project from scratch.
  Due to the fact of us using the "emmet" plugin, we may just type "html" and hit "Enter". After that the boilerplate code will be generated.
  Boilerplates are similar to having code templates, something which you will reused in your projects.
  Curiosity: This term comes from the days when the printing press would have iron plates that would function as their template.
             And because of the similarity between the printing press and the plate that identify the builder of a steam boiler, they call it a boilerplate.

<!-- The first line in a HTML file
  This line is where it's defined the document type, this document type has as purpose to tell the browser which version of HTML to render the project.
  The version of HTML being used in this course is the version 5. In previous versions the way to define the document type was extremely convoluted.
-->

<!-- The "<html>" Tag
  This tells the browser that evrything enclosed by it is HTML code.
  The code within this tag consists of a "<head>" and "<body>".
-->

<!-- The "<head>" Tag
  It's where the HTML code holds information about the webpage and tells the browser how it should handle the page.
  As an example, we have at our disposal the "<title>" tag, which is used to give a title to the webpage.
-->

<!-- Opening file in the browser
  By typing the path of the HTML file in the browser, the file will be opened there.
-->

<!-- The "<meta>" Element
  It's used to give extra metadata to your HTML document. It's possible to define information about the site and how it should be rendered.
  In the case below, we are telling the browser that everything inside the HTML page is encoded using the "utf-8" encoding system.
  Mojibake is the name of the term when your browser is trying to render the characters using the wrong character set. Due to that you have a page with an unreadable text.
  There are quite a few types of Text Encoding and they tend to vary by language, since different languages use different symbols.
  "utf-8" includes all the unicode character set, containing from emojis to several symbols used in other languages.
  Also, by using this type of encoding we give your site the maximum chance of being rendered correctly if visited by international visitors.

  Search Engines and the "<meta>" Atributes
    Search Engines look for speficic metatypes in your file to display information for the user.
    For example, by using the "description" value, you can insert text that's displayed below the link of the site when searched on Google.

<html lang="en" dir="ltr">

<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
