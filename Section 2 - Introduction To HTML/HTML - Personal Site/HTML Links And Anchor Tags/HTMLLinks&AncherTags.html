<!-- HTML
  HTML stands for "HyperText Markup Language", and the "HyperText" part is a bunch of text documents that can be linked together, a hyperlink.
  The "Markup" language part is the style that we change through tags.
-->

<!-- Adding Hyperlinks
  In order to add a hyperlink, we need to add a "<a>" tag, or "Anchor tag", and we have to provide an HTML attribute to this tag.
  The HTML attribute that we have to provide is the "href" that is a URL that the hyperlink points to.
  The URL could be a local path or a website URL.
  Between the anchor open tag and closing tag is our link text.
-->

<!-- Highlight of a Hyperlink
  By convention the highlight is going to be blue if it is a link that we have never clicked on. And it becomes purple if we have clicked on it in the past.
