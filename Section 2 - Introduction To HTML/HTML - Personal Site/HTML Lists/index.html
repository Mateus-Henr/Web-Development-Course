<!-- Bullet Lists
  These are the ones that don't contain an order. They are rendered as bulleted lists.
  Therefore the "<ul>" tag is used to represent a Unordered List and for each item ("List Item") in the list we use "<li>".
-->

<!-- Number List
  This format of list does have an order, for that reason we wield the "<ol>" tag, standing for "Ordered List".
  The "<li>" tag is also used for this type of list.
