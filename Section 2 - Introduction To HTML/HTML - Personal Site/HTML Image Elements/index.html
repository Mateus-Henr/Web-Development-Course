<!-- The "<img>" Tag
  The Image tag is also a self0-closing tag.
  However this image HTML element requires an HTML attribute that is used to specify the source of the image.
  The HTML attribute in question is the "src" and it can either fetch it from the internet or a local image.
  When using a URL as the source the browser has to download the image.
-->

<!-- The "alt" Attribute
  This attribute is used in case of the browser not being able to render. So this text will be appearing instead.
  It's used to decribe what the image was about.
  When it comes to Search Engine Optimization, this attribute is also very interesting since depending on the content
  of this tag it will help Google to rank you website. In other words, Google looks at this tag to see what the site is about.
-->

<!-- Local Image
  In case of the provider of the image is down or no loger exists, the image won't be loaded into your website.
  Due to the fact spoken above, we can drag the image into the project folder and use the path to it instead of an URL.
