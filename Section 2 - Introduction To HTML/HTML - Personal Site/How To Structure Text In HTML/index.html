<!-- The "<p>" Tag
  This tag formats text into a paragraph.
-->

<!-- Italicizing tags
  The "<i>" tag is used to italicize the content within its eclosing tags.
  However the "<em>" is also used for the same purpose and visually they are identical.
  The difference is that the "<em>" tag tells the browser that the words that are enclosed within it should be stressed/emphazised.
  Differently from the "<i>" tag that only styles the text and doesn't cofer this emphasis.
  GOOD PRACTISE - Always use "<em>" since it porvides more information.
-->

<!-- Making text bold
  Similarly from the two tags that can be used to perform italicizing, we have "<b>" and "<strong>" that can be used to bold a text.
  The "<strong>" tag is the one that should be used since it gives information to the browser, the opposite to the "<b>" tag.
