The Bash Shell
According to always hungry Angela, we can view the both the shell and the kernel as a pistachio. The "nut" of the pistachio is the kernel (the core of the OS),
and the "shell" of the pistachio is the shell (user interface for interacting with the kernel).

Types of Shell
Graphic User Interface - The file explorer is an example.
Command Line Interface - When you type commands to the kernel.

Bash Shell
It stands for "Bourne Again Shell". This is a command line interpreter for the UNIX system, being one example of it, Linux.

Why To Use the Command Line
Flexibility, quickness and more control.
